# This script runs multiple extractions in parallel. Change the directories,
# the target ID, the number of cores, and the time to match the number of
# silent files and the target you are working with. Consulting
# "decoy_counts.txt" in /global/project/projectdirs/m1532/downloads/CASP12/
# will tell you how many PDB files must be extracted. Unfortunately, there is
# no reliable way to estimate the time it will take to extract a given number
# of PDB files, but we have found that some silent files containing 60K files 
# take roughly 9 hours, while one containing 90K takes roughly 12 hours. Silent
# files containing more than 130K PDBs will probably not be extractable within
# the 48 hour time limit on NERSC's Cori, although full extraction may not
# matter for your case. 
#
# This script assumes that the silent files have been placed in their
# appropriate subdirectories. It will create a subdirectory within the silent
# file directory called 'pdbs/' and will output all files there. 
#
# The quality of service (qos) operator can be set to regular or premium.
# Premium doubles the cost of the hours you allocate but provides rapid turn
# around, while regular will most likeluy result in a multi-day delay. 
#
# Obviously add as many lines as needed to match your case, and update the node
# count accordingly.
